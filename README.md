Overview
This project implements a graphical user interface (GUI) version of the classic game "Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock" using Java Swing. The game extends the traditional Rock, Paper, Scissors game by adding two more options: Lizard and Spock. It allows players to choose between five moves and displays computer-generated moves. The winner is determined based on the rules of the extended game, and scores are tracked and displayed for both the player and the computer.
