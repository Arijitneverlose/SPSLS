Overview
This project implements a graphical user interface (GUI) version of the classic game "Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock" using Java Swing. The game extends the traditional Rock, Paper, Scissors game by adding two more options: Lizard and Spock. It allows players to choose between five moves and displays computer-generated moves.
